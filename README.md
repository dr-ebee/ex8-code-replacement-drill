***tl;dr replace code with a comment, then re-write code from the comment (make commits each step)***

Practice taking code that's difficult to understand and breaking it down into small pieces

**Goal:** Improve ability to **interpret** and **generate** code

## What to do?

1. Find some existing, *working* code.
2. For each line in the code:

    a) Write a comment above the line that describes what it does.
    
    b) Delete the line of code that you made a comment for. **(Only delete one line at a time!)**
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has the comment, and doesn't have the code
                                         Commit message can be "comment"
          
    c) Below the comment you made, write code that does that job.
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has both the comment and the code
                                         Commit message can be "code"
                                         
3. Break the code into larger "chunks". For each chunk of code:

    a) Write a comment above the chunk of code that describes what it does.
    
    b) Delete the chunk of code that you made a comment for. **(Only delete one chunk of code at a time!)**
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has the comment, and doesn't have the code
                                         Commit message can be "comment"
          
    c) Below the comment you made, write code that does that job.
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has both the comment and the code
                                         Commit message can be "code"
                                         
4. Keep increasing the size of the chunks of code until you are commenting and re-writing the code for the entire program.
